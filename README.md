Ragdoll

This is a video tutorial I followed from Brackeys https://youtu.be/DInV-jHm9rk?si=fHTpmCiJd3XqXPaF

I found this extremely useful for a multiplayer golf game project I am also working on. 

Challenges: Learning how to connect the Unity joints to the 3D model.

Learned: How to create a realistic ragdoll in Unity3D.
